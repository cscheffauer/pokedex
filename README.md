## [Demo](https://cscheffauer.github.io/pokedex)

This Pokedex App allows you to search for your favourite Pokemon.

## Tech

This Pokedex App uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [React] - a JS library for building user interfaces!
* [React.lazy] - to render React components dynamically
* [Redux] - a predictable state container for JS apps
* [Redux Thunk] - Redux middleware
* [React-Relay] - GraphQL Client (by Facebook)
* [GraphQL] - new query language for an API
